# Project13-IoT-COVID-counter-for-Room-or-Lab-Access
IITP Summer Program 2021 Project 13

Many Universities face the dilemma of having to enforce rules and regulations for the number of students that are allowed in a laboratory or classroom environment during the COVID crisis. Most schools will have to deal with these issues on an ongoing basis for many years to come as it becomes obvious that keeping people healthy indoors revolves around the population in a given area and the social distancing of those people. This project will address the technologies that might be used to regulate and enforce pandemic-based rules using an IoT system.
